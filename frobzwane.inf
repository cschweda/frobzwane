! FROBSWANE: A Post-Underground Excavation
! Inform 6 Source File
! ============================================
!
! This file demonstrates Inform 6 game development with extensive comments
! for newcomers to the language. Inform 6 is a programming language for
! creating interactive fiction (text adventure) games.
!
! ============================================
! SECTION 1: GAME METADATA
! ============================================

! Constants define game information that appears in the story file header
! "Story" is the game title shown when the game starts
Constant Story "FROBSWANE";

! "Headline" is a subtitle or tagline shown below the title
! The ^ symbols create line breaks in the output
Constant Headline "^A Post-Underground Excavation^";

! ============================================
! SECTION 2: LIBRARY INCLUDES
! ============================================

! Inform 6 uses library files that provide standard parser functionality
! These are included from the lib/inform6lib/ directory
! 
! "parser" provides the command parser (understanding player input)
! "verblib" provides standard verb definitions (take, drop, look, etc.)
Include "parser";
Include "verblib";

! ============================================
! SECTION 3: REQUIRED LIBRARY STUBS
! ============================================
!
! The Inform 6 library expects certain routines to exist. These are "stubs"
! - empty routines that can be overridden later for custom behavior.
! For now, we provide minimal implementations that do nothing.
!
! These routines are called by the library at various points:
! - NewRoom: Called when entering a new room (can customize behavior)
! - LookRoutine: Called when player types "look" (can customize)
! - AfterSave/AfterRestore: Called after save/restore operations
! - PrintRank: Called when displaying score rank
! - ObjectDoesNotFit: Called when trying to put object in container that's too small
! - DarkToDark: Called when trying to move in darkness
! - GamePreRoutine/GamePostRoutine: Called before/after each turn
! - Amusing: Called for special responses (like typing XYZZY)
! - DeathMessage: Called when player dies
! - Epilogue: Called at game end
! - ParseNoun/ParseNumber: Called during parsing (can customize noun recognition)
! - AfterLife: Called after death (for resurrection, etc.)
! - TimePasses: Called each turn (for time-based events)
! - PrintVerb: Called when printing verb in messages
! - InScope: Determines if object is visible/accessible
! - ParserError: Called on parser errors (can customize error messages)
! - ChooseObjects: Called when parser needs to disambiguate objects
! - BeforeParsing: Called before parsing player input
! - UnknownVerb: Called when player uses unknown verb
! - AfterPrompt: Called after displaying the prompt (>)

! ============================================
! SECTION 4: COMPILER CONSTANTS
! ============================================

! ZCODE_VERSION tells the compiler which Z-machine version to target
! Version 5 supports up to 256 KB and is widely compatible
! Version 8 supports up to 512 KB but requires newer interpreters
Constant ZCODE_VERSION = 5;

! TOTAL_SCORE defines the maximum possible score
! Note: MAX_SCORE is already defined in verblib.h, so we use TOTAL_SCORE
! This will be used when implementing the scoring system
Constant TOTAL_SCORE = 350;

! ============================================
! SECTION 5: GLOBAL STATE VARIABLES
! ============================================
!
! Global variables track the game's state - what has happened, what puzzles
! are solved, what items are in what state, etc.
!
! These are used throughout the game to:
! - Change room descriptions based on state
! - Enable/disable exits based on puzzle completion
! - Track puzzle progress
! - Store game statistics

! Puzzle state variables - track whether puzzles are solved
Global front_hall_cleaned = false;      ! Has the front hall been cleaned with the dryer?
Global reservoir_drained = false;       ! Has the reservoir been drained?
Global throne_rotated = false;         ! Has the throne been rotated?

! Resource tracking
Global lamp_turns = 800;               ! Remaining battery life for the lamp (in turns)
Global decoder_ring_charged = false;   ! Is the decoder ring charged with espresso?
Global paste_uses = 0;                 ! How many times has the cereal paste been used?

! Scoring
! Note: 'score' is already defined in the library, so we don't declare it here

! F-R-O-B puzzle state - tracks which letters are showing on the four panels
Global panel1_letter = 'A';
Global panel2_letter = 'B';
Global panel3_letter = 'C';
Global panel4_letter = 'D';

! Valve puzzle state - tracks which valves have been turned
Global valve_hot_turned = false;
Global valve_cold_turned = false;
Global valve_existential_turned = false;

! CV submission state - tracks which CV components have been submitted
Global cv_card_submitted = false;
Global cv_gown_submitted = false;
Global cv_grant_submitted = false;
Global cv_waiver_submitted = false;

! Finale state
Global house_collapsing = false;       ! Is the house collapsing?

! ============================================
! SECTION 6: INITIALIZATION
! ============================================
!
! The Initialise routine runs once when the game starts.
! It sets up the initial game state - where the player starts, initial
! values, etc.

[ Initialise;
    ! "location" is a special global variable that holds the current room
    ! This sets the starting location to Prairie_Overlook
    location = Prairie_Overlook;
];

! ============================================
! SECTION 7: ROOM DEFINITIONS
! ============================================
!
! Rooms are defined using the "Object" keyword. In Inform 6, everything is
! an object - rooms, items, NPCs, etc.
!
! Room syntax:
!   Object RoomName "Display Name"
!       with description "Room description text",
!       direction_to OtherRoom,
!       has light;  (or has dark, or neither for conditional lighting)
!
! Properties:
!   - description: Text shown when player enters or types "look"
!   - n_to, s_to, e_to, w_to: North, south, east, west exits
!   - u_to, d_to: Up, down exits
!   - in_to, out_to: Enter, exit (for containers, buildings, etc.)
!   - has light: Room is always lit (player can see)
!   - has dark: Room is always dark (needs light source)
!   - No light property: Room uses default lighting rules

! ============================================
! ACT I: SURFACE ROOMS
! ============================================

! Global variables for puzzle gates (must be defined before rooms that use them)
Global grating_opened = false;         ! Has the grating been opened?
Global rope_attached = false;           ! Has a rope been attached for crossing?

! These are called by the library when certain actions occur.
!
! Action routine naming: [ActionNameSub obj; ... ]
! The "Sub" suffix means this is a subroutine for that action.
! Return true to indicate the action was handled, false to let library handle it.

! UseSub - handles the "use" action (when player types "use object")
! Note: Temporarily disabled to debug memory errors
! [ UseSub obj;
!     ! Check if the object being used is the hand-dryer
!     ! In Inform 6, obj is an object number, so we compare to the object identifier
!     if (obj == Hand_Dryer) {

!             return true;
!         }
!     }

!     return false;
! ];

! ============================================
! END OF SOURCE FILE
! ============================================
!
! This is a basic Inform 6 game structure. As development continues:
! - More rooms will be added
! - More objects will be implemented
! - Custom verbs (YANK, CRUSH, SPIT ON, etc.) will be added
! - NPCs will be implemented
! - Puzzles will be completed
! - Scoring system will be finished
!
! For more information, see:
! - README.md - Project overview
! - INFORM6_COMPILATION_GUIDE.md - How to compile
! - FROBSWANE_Complete_Design.md - Full game design
! - walkthrough.md - Complete playthrough guide

! ============================================
! SECTION 10: GRAMMAR DEFINITIONS
! ============================================
!
! The grammar.h file MUST be included at the end of the source file.
! It defines all standard verbs and their synonyms:
!   - LOOK (L) - examine your surroundings
!   - EXAMINE (X) - look at something closely
!   - TAKE (GET) - pick up an object
!   - DROP - put down an object
!   - INVENTORY (I) - list what you're carrying
!   - GO (N, S, E, W, etc.) - move in a direction
!   - OPEN, CLOSE, PUSH, PULL, etc.
!
! Standard Infocom shortcuts are included:
!   L = LOOK
!   X = EXAMINE
!   I = INVENTORY
!   Z = WAIT
!   G = AGAIN (repeat last command)
!
! This include MUST come AFTER all object and room definitions.
